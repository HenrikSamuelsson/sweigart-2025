# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python – Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions, exercises, and project work
from the book:

> Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (3rd Edition)  
> by Al Sweigart, No Starch Press

The purpose of this repository is learning and practice.  
Solutions may differ from the author’s examples and are written to reinforce
understanding rather than to provide canonical answers.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized roughly by book chapters and projects.

Typical content includes:

- Short exercises and practice questions
- Small automation scripts
- Chapter projects and extensions
- Refactored or improved versions of example code
- Notes and experiments created while learning

Folder names and structure may evolve as the book progresses.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Code is written by hand, not copied verbatim from the book
- Emphasis on:
  - Readability
  - Correctness
  - Incremental improvement
- Scripts are intentionally simple and practical, matching the spirit of the
  book

This repository is primarily for personal reference, but may also be useful
to others studying Python for automation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This is not an official repository
- All rights to the book content belong to Al Sweigart and No Starch Press

- No full book text or copyrighted material is included

If you are learning Python, I strongly recommend purchasing and reading the
book yourself.

## 🛠 Requirements
